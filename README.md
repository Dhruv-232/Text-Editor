# Text-Editor

## Description 
Module 19 challenge required us to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is required to be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Technologies Used:

- IndexedDB for creating an object store with GET and PUT methods.
- Webpack for bundling JavaScript files, generating HTML files, service workers, and a manifest file.
- Babel for converting next-gen JavaScript to ES5.
- Workbox for pre-caching static assets using a service worker.
- WebpackPwaManifest plug-in for generating the manifest file for the PWA.

## Usage:

The text editor allows you to create notes or write code snippets with an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface. You can save your work automatically inside the editor when the DOM window is unfocused. The application has been designed to resemble the mock-up functionality provided in the Challenge instructions. With this app, you can work online or offline and install it as a web app on your desktop or mobile device.

## Installation

To use the text editor, you can access the deployed application URL on Heroku or install it as a PWA by clicking on the "Install" button, which will download it as an icon on your desktop or mobile device.
